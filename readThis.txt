This project is seperated into three programs:

Data Reading: 

- datareading.py

- This script reads pcapng data from the linked file, and converts to CSV data
- For HTTP information as well as general packets informatin

Data Cleaning:

- cleanerUpper.py

- This file takes the read data produced by datareading.py and cleans it for analysis
- The files that it uses are already created by the previous script so there is no need to create new files
- Towards the end of the file there is feature extraction based on the available data

EDA:

- EDA.py
- This is an optional script that is not necessary if you want to run the program as is
- It is intended to build a basic visual understanding of the data for more complex analysis

Analysis:

- analysisVisual.py

- This script produces visuals for meaningful insight into the security posture of the network being analyzed.
